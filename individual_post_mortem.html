                <p>
                    During the course of the project I worked on many features,
                    some from scratch and some that I had to jump into later either because of
                    imidiate bugs that I could fix or because the person who started it was sick.
                    Therefore i will quickly present some of the more major features I worked on.
                </p>

                <p class="stairs">
                    One of the first features i worked on was the "stairs" that later became a sort
                    of whirlwind that visually shoots the ducklings up onto blocks.
                </p>

                <img class="img-stairs" src="Images/stairs.png" alt="Image of stairs">

                <p class="stairs">
                    In the end it worked by disabling the gravity and movment affecting the duckling
                    then taking the position of the oposit end of the stairs plus some Y and X axis ofset so it would
                    land
                    on the block, and adding to the ducklings position until it reached that top of the stairs,
                    at which point the gravity and movment would be turned on again.
                    There are more parts of the stairs but not enough wordls so let's move on to the next feature i
                    made.
                </p>
                <p class="command-handler">
                    The actual first feature i made was the command handler. Which worked together
                    with other systems made by Zakk and Tindra and me later on place tools and
                    commands into the levels. It's a simple static class with some static functions which
                    did two things. The first function is <code>SwitchTool(GameTools tool, bool allowed)</code>.
                    <br>
                    It takes a <code> GameTools</code> enum which dictates what tool the active one should be and also
                    an <code>allowed</code>
                    bool that tells the script if it is allowd to place tools or not (connected to if the player has
                    used all possible moves or not).
                </p>
                <p class="command-handler">

                    The second function is
                    <code>HandleInput(Cell cellType, bool allowed)</code>.
                    It takes a <code>Cell</code> enum which tells the command handler which
                    cell or part of the game is pressed, then it calculates if the command selected
                    (which is saved in a static and global <code>current tool</code> variable)
                    can be used or placed at the selected cell. and if so it alters the <code>Cell</code> passed in
                    to have the command or object be addded or swapped there. The <code>HandleInput</code>
                    functions also sends information to a script that keeps track of moves made to see if
                    a limit is reached or not.
                </p>
                <p class="pipes">
                    Last feature I will tell you about is the pipe system. The pipe system
                    wasn't made by me but the person fixing some major game breaking bugs in it was sick.
                    So it fell on my table to fix. The pipe systems feature was to work as a teleporter between
                    pipes. At first <b>there was light</b>.
